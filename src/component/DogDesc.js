With a great sense of smell and superior tracking instinct, the beagle is employed as detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent but single-minded. It is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and lack of inherited health problems.</p>;

                <li>Scenthounds, that follow prey or others (like missing people) by tracking its scent. These dogs have endurance but are not fast runners.</li>
